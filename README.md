# CPG-Deck-Builder
I don't know if I'll complete this project but it came to me while on holiday. Basically, what if Slay the Spire was procedurally generated? My hopes for this is that all cards, skills, and enemies will be procedurally generated, unlocking potentially millions of combonations.

To balance this, there will be ways that it increases the chances of getting certains cards and attributes, so you have some control over the deck you end up with.
